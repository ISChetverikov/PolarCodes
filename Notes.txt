1) Parameters L and D of LIST and STACK decoders works only with powers of 2. reason is integer log of them is calculated.
2) SCS decoder works only with P1 domain
3) D > L, log D < n
4) OPerations count for LLR and MINSUM
5) define for operations counting`
6) optimized SC and SCS decoder only with minsum LLR
7) optimized SC decoder without CRC
8) all versions of list and stack does not work with CRC
